Title: Socket Chatroom
In this project I have use python to develop a chatroom using a Socket. The idea of it is to have a client side and a server side to communicate between two or more clients. The server needs to accept the connection from the client. At this point the user is displayed by IP address. In the program it allows users to us user names. After that the server will display in coming messages that have been collected.
To run the program:
1.Lucht he Server.py and run.
2.Lunch Client.py and run it. 
3.Select a user name. 
4.Now we can see the commutation between the client and the sever.
